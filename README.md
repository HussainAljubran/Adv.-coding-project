# Working-with-Olympics-Data-Set-in-MySQL-from-Scratch


## For the following analysis I have use the Olympics data

``` SQL
USE Olympics;
```
## I want to know the number of Countris 
``` SQL
USE Olympics;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) AS Country
FROM outturnolympicgames;
```

f(false) means not available, t(true) means available 

## 2 purpose: calculates the percentage of available (t) and unavailable (f) dates.
Explanation value_counts(normalize=True) give proportion. Multiplaying by 100 converts the proportion into percentage


``` diff
availability_percentage = calendar['available'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
availability_percentage
```
